## FAQ

### What is Bootstrap?
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a [responsive](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design) frontend web design framework.  It allows for websites to be designed quickly and work on a multitude of devices.  The main idea of Bootstrap is applying it's classes to different html elements to style them.  Bootstrap using a [grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid), with div's for rows and div's for columns.  By doing something like:

    <div class = "row>
        <div class = "col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p> First column </p>
        </div>
        <div class = "col-sm-12 col-md-6">
            <p> Second column </p>
        </div>
    </div>

Will make a row, and then two columns.  On a mobile device ("sm") the columns with be stacked one on top of the other.  This is because by default Bootstrap has 12 columns per row.  On a computer ("md) or higher resolution (such s as tv) it will put the collumns one next to the other, because the class for medium displays is "col-md-6".  Each collumn will take up half of the row, since a row can have a total of 12 columns.

The ".main" *<div>* of the website is a [container](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#overview-container).  The *container* that surrounds all our content allows it to be responsive, it allows it to scale with different screen sizes.  The ".main" css has *margin-left:auto* and *margin-right:auto*, this centers the main content.  It also uses [relative sizing](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp), **ex:** *width: 80%* , this also allows the content to change it's size relative to the screen the user is using to view the website.

### What is jQuery?
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a Javascript library for manipulating the [DOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) (Document Object Model).  The DOM is how an HTML document is organized.  Using jQuery you can pull out html elements and change their properties.  jQuery can also be [event-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming), firing off code when a user interface component is manpulated.  To start a jQuery code you need to do the following in the *<head>* of a web page:

    <script>
    $( document ).ready(function(){
        console.log("Hello World);
    });
    </script>
    
*$( document ).ready()* runs code as soon as the webpage is able to be manipulated.  

To select and element from the HTML document use **$()**.  For example, you can select all *<a>* tags with **$("a")**.
Or all elements with the class *hello* with **$(".hello")**
Or all elements with the id of *bye* with **$("#bye")**.
Basically, any [css selector](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) will work to select a DOM element with jQuery.
